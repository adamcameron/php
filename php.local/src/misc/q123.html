<li>Provide a brief comment about yourself (don't worry about your CFML usage or dev work just yet: this is just about you). Don't worry if you'd rather not give too much detail, that's cool. Note if you mention your name, I might end up sharing it in the context of what you had to say in your other answers.</li>
<li>How did you come to be a developer, and are you primarily a developer or is it an adjunct to another role (like a sysop or designer or something like that)?</li>
<li>Summarise your CFML usage timeline (just timeline for this one). Include things like what year you started, when you moved on, if you have. (or what's the time timetable for moving on if it's just planned). Mention versions in this one.</li>

Respondent 1<br><blockquote><ol><li>This is my own answer: Adam Cameron. I'm London-based and (breaking my own rule slightly here) have been a dev for 16 years and in the IT industry for... blimey... 23 years.</li>
<li>I did programming at polytech, and loved it. I then took the first job that presented itself to me, which was as a sysop & desktop support bod on a NetWare network. I started using CFML there just before I went abroad for a few years. On return I got offered a job as a CFML dev with no professional programming experience at all.</li>
<li>I started in 2001, and stuck with it until 2014. I shifted to PHP because the company I work for did. During that time I used all versions of CF from 4.5->9 professionally, but also have good knowledge of 10-12 as well, as I've been involved heavily in the CFML community and testing of ColdFusion's CFML implementation. I've never used any other CFML platform other than ColdFusion, other than experimentally & community participation.</li>

College wasn't so successful for me due to lack of focus. Mid 90s, I learned html, photoshop, etc. Spring of 97, I considered myself a CF Developer. My career has taken to me to Japan for about a week, which was definitely fun / interesting.</li>
<li>I was working as QA / Customer Support for a dot com company that buys / sells steel online. I had the basics of HTML behind me and excelled at it. The company sent me to ColdFusion training where I learned "Fast Track to ColdFusion" with Glenda Vigoreaux as my instructor (R.I.P.)

My HTML knowledge came in handy in class, the java developers were struggling and asking me questions. That got relayed back to management and I found myself moving from QA to Development.

Right place, right time? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
<li>* Spring of 97, learned CFML (CF 4.01 - Allaire)
* ~2013, learned ColdBox on the job at WBM and launched edex.adobe.com
* ~Feb 2014, ex-CTO signed everyone up for Go training
* Since that time, I've been 50/50 on CF/Go, maintaining current CF site while rebuilding in Go. I've hired another CF Developer (Charlie Griefer) to help do the CF -> Go transition.
* As of this year, I'm 20/80 CF/Go. My goal is to kill off CF once and for all by the end of the year.
* I'm also assisting launching a 2nd Go project into production as well. WBM will no longer start new projects on CF.</li>

<li>tl;dr; version: Left school with aptitude towards programming and web development, but didn't want to "work with computers about computers" all day long. Attempted a BA (music technology) and dropped out after about 8 months. Thought it'd be nice to be an author so started a BA (languages and literature). Got 2/3 done and... dropped out again. Wasted a few more years on misspent "youth". Became a yoga instructor. Met my future wife, pulled my socks up, did an HND in information systems & internet technology (main server side language was Java, but never learnt how to package/deploy my Java to an actual server - the shortfalls of some education systems). Got a job at an ISP coding as a .NET dev. Was waaaaay underpaid so changed jobs and landed up doing ColdFusion. Loved it. Stuck with it. Moved to the UK and kept working with it.</li>
<li>Started doing ColdFusion (versions 7 - 9) in my web dev role back in 2009 (I think). Loved it. Kept working with it. Moved countries and worked with versions 9 - 11, did one or two small Railo projects, and have been playing around a little with Lucee recently. Still have a love for ColdFusion, but can see how it's a potential career dead-end so have been wanting to switch to something more mainstream for a few years now. Wanted to get back into .NET a while back, but found the prospect of learning the .NET library rather daunting as it is a big beast in and of itself. Have been upskilling on front end tech like Angular JS, but prefer server side technologies. Joined various functional programming groups (Clojure, FP, Haskell, F#, etc) to get a feel for each community. Seem to have settled on learning Clojure for the immediate future (I'd like to be at a level where I could potentially switch our code at work onto Clojure or get another Clojure job within a year) with the idea to move on from there and do some studying up on Java again. And then possibly something like Kotlin, Haskell or Go.</li>

I quickly found that I enjoyed doing server-side stuff with Perl and mainly focused on the back end for the next 20 years or so. For the past ten or so I've focused more on the front-end and now consider myself more a full stack type of person.

First heard of CFML in 2005 when asked in a "Multimedia Designer" interview "Do you know ColdFusion?"

Of course, I said no, but it turns out the guy who wrote the companies "extranet" did it in CF and left just before I got there.

Started looking into maintaining the system he wrote, and his code seemed very messy to me (even though I didn't know anything about coding) so I looked up "ColdFusion podcast" and found the CF Weekly Podcast with Matt Woodward and Peter Ferrell.

<li>ColdFusion was used at the University before I was hired (in 2008). The previous CMS was built on .NET and a decision to replace it was made shortly before I started working here. I was involved in the process to choose a replacement. The choices were Sharepoint, another .NET CMS and a ColdFusion CMS. I voted for the ColdFusion CMS and it won.

It was in a very large corporate environment and I found myself doing cool stuff that allowed ideas to quickly become working prototypes and finally solutions for 20,000 staff. Since then 80% of my public server-side work has been CFML based. Been using CF8 for 9 years and we're going to upgrade to CF 2016.</li>

I got my undergrad in PolySci only to find that it didn't really lead to work, but I've been messing around with computers since early on which lead to some rudimentary IT-related jobs. In the end, I got the chance to pick up some web development work here and there on the side and it eventually lead to a full-time job.</li>

</ol></blockquote><hr>Respondent 46<br><blockquote><ol><li>I'm Gary Stanton, a freelance webdev based in Brighton, UK. Primarily contracting for a few clients and have been building bespoke systems for well over a decade.</li>
<li>I have no formal training beyond some very limited exposure to Turbo Pascal and Cobol in college.

Back in the late 90's I was primarily designing, and coding websites for anyone who'd pay me to do so. Static HTML, tables for layout, all that lovely stuff. My focus was mainly on the design at that stage.

In the early 2000's I was working for a small startup e-commerce company using an off-the-shelf offline package. As we grew, we began to need something more bespoke and dynamic. We were approached by a CF developer who ended up building our new system and so I was forced to familiarise myself with CF... It was so easy to get involved in the server side, and the possibilities excited me far more than design... I never looked back really.

Dev is my core function, but with most of my clients I have to act as sysop as well. I do a bit of design and UX too if I can’t avoid it.</li>
<li>I’ve been using CF from about 2003 I think. I  started on MX so have only ever experienced JVM versions.

I've worked with every version up until CF11

Around 2012 I think, I began to use Railo for some clients and now split about 60/40 between ACF and Lucee.

I’m not moving on yet, but front end dev has become a bigger part of my workload in the last 3 years or so.</li>

<li>In 1994, while working as a COBOL developer, I convinced my manager to consider a website for our agency.  In my spare time I built our first site.

<li>Worked blue collar for about 5 years after high school. Got tired of that and started community college for web design. My dad was doing contract design work on a project that was using CF4. He bought me teach yourself CF in 24 hours and made me read it. Been doing CF and full stack dev for about 15 years.</li>
<li>First used CF 4 on a contract gig in 2002 ish. Got a full time job doing Fusebox3 work on CF 5 in 2003. Still at that job. We have always updated after the first update patch. So, I've used CF 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The switch from 9 to 10 (jrun to tomcat) was worse than 5 to 6 (c++ to Java). We had to load balance back and forth between old code on our CF 9 boxes and current code and completely crash multiple times as we worked out IIS connector issues with Adobe. It was a nightmare.

In 2015 we did a "language extravaganza" and did the same example project in a bunch of lang+DB combos. Golang won us over hands down. Last year we did a lot of work on a totally new microservices platform and launched a couple of "toy" projects. This year 3 mission critical apps will launch on that platform. Hopefully within 3-5 years we will completely replace and retire CF.</li>

<li>I was an IT Director/DBA/CRM&ERP SysAdmin/BI Analyst at my last job. We had a dealer website powered by ACF. When my CF developer left for a much better job, I took on his duties too (what was one more hat?), and learned CF on the fly looking at this code and Google. I was hooked. Web development was much more fun than anything else I had done in 2 decades of IT, and CF was easy to pickup. I'm now a web developer & mobile app developer.</li>
<li>Been working with CF for about 11 years, 9 in earnest. Started in late 2005 picking at the language, working with CF6, and moved to CF7 and working with it day to day in 2008. Moved to a larger company with 2 other developers (running CF8 & 9, currently using CF10) for the last 8 years. We've gotten tired of the lack of interest from Adobe in truly expanding and improving the platform (let's add HTML charts! And mobile apps! And ignore all this other stuff that's been broken!) As well as the expense of maintenance and support and their VM licensing. We are planning on moving away from CF by 2020, but we haven't decided on the replacement language yet.</li>

<li>In the mid-'90's I started doing database work for colleagues, mostly as favors and without formal training. When Allaire Cold Fusion came out, I started using it because it was a quick way to get reports on an intranet. I've been primarily a CFML developer since then, though now I spend a significant amount of my time doing system architecture and cloud infrastructure work.</li>
<li>Started with Allaire's second major release. I've used most versions of ColdFusion since then, but stopped at Adobe ColdFusion 10. It's extremely unlikely that I would purchase another license from Adobe. I still have a few instances of Adobe ColdFusion 10 kicking around.

I started using New Atlanta BlueDragon when I switched to primarily Linux-based servers. I used Open BlueDragon for a while after that.

I started using Railo 3.1 in 2009. Until pretty recently, I supported some older deploys of that engine.

I use Lucee for all new deployments of my company's applications.</li>
